Abstract Modern development methods are believed to best suit small, co-located
companies, but the success is not guaranteed. For one, it is not very large-scale
nor good. An interpretative revela-
tory case study was done. Findings on key areas are reported: customer involvement, software archi-
tecture, and inter-team coordination.
